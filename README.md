LittleLink is a lightweight DIY alternative to services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee)
and [many.link](https://many.link/). I forked this to publish as a project page using github and will add additional logos which I need but not necessarily everyone else.

NOTES FOR ME:
Change colors via: `skeleton-light.css` or `skeleton-dark.css` to the HEX values of your choosing.
Automatic theme option: You can also set your CSS to `skeleton-auto.css`, which will use the system theme of the device you visit on.

This branch will be used for development so that the main branch will function as the website itself.
